what is the differnce between forEach() map() and filter() ?
forEach(): The forEach() executes a provided function once on each and every element of an array.
example:
arr =[1,2,3,4,5]

arr.forEach((item)=>{
    console.log(item)
})

map():The map() executes the provided function on all the elements of the array who passes the and returns a new array without 
making any change to the original array. 
example:
arr.map(arr => arr*2);

filter:The filter() executes the provided function and passes the elements of the array who satisfies the condition by the provided function and returns a 
new array without making any change to original array.
example:
ages =[21,5,21,18,40];
console.log(ages.filter(checkAges));
  function checkAges(ages){
   return ages > 18;
  }
 const result = ages.filter(age => age > 18)
 console.log(result);

The main difference between these methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map, filter does not 
allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one.
